 # Breief Explanation About Revenue API ENDPOINT; 
 
 # Importing Dependencies:

# The payment model is imported from the ../modals/payment.js file, which is presumably a Mongoose model representing payment data in a MongoDB collection.
 
 # Function Definition:

# The revenuetotal function takes req (request) and res (response) objects as parameters, which are part of an Express.js route handler.


# Extracting Request Data:

# The function extracts year and month from the request body (req.body).


# Pipeline Construction:

# An aggregation pipeline array (pipeline) is initialized to store MongoDB aggregation stages.


# If year and month are provided, a $match stage is added to the pipeline to filter documents by the specified year and month based on the timestamp field.


# A $group stage is added to group the documents by year and month and calculate the total billable_amount for each group.


# A $sort stage is added to sort the results by year and month in ascending order.


# Executing Aggregation:

# The payment.aggregate(pipeline) method executes the constructed pipeline on the payment collection.


# The results are mapped to a more user-friendly format, with each entry containing year, month, and total.


# Response Handling:

# The formatted result is returned as a JSON response with a status code of 200 if successful.


# If an error occurs, a 500 status code and an error message are returned.


# This function allows clients to request total revenue data, optionally filtered by year and month, and receive the results in a structured format.






# Steps:
1. Import the Payment Data Model from Mongoose; 
2. Define a Asynchronous Revenue Function; 
3. Request the month and year From the User; 
4. Initialise a Mongodb Aggregation Pipeline that is Initially Empty{  
 let pipeline=[];
} 
Here Year and month are user Required Input:- 


if (year && month) {
  pipeline.push({
    $match: {
      $expr: {
        $and: [
          { $eq: [{ $year: "$timestamp" }, parseInt(year)] },
          { $eq: [{ $month: "$timestamp" }, parseInt(month)] }
        ]
      }
    }
  });
} 


# Add a Group Stage: 
Extract the yearwise and monthwise Revenue and Calculate the total Revenue; 


pipeline.push({
  $group: {
    _id: {
      year: { $year: "$timestamp" },
      month: { $month: "$timestamp" }
    },
    total: { $sum: "$billable_amount" }
  }
});
# Total will return the total Revenue;
